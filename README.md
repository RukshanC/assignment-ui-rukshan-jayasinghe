This is the concept home page design for Runescape (https://oldschool.runescape.com/)

If you played fantasy games on your computer in the early 2000s then you are
probably very familiar with the iconic fanfare that slowly plays on the login screen of
this website. RuneScape was launched in 2001 by the company Jagex as a Massively
Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game.

The game is a nonlinear sandbox that drops you into a medieval world with little to no
guidance and allows the player to grind and level up skills instead of choosing a class
like most RPG’s. While the original game servers from 2001 have been shut down,
Jagex now runs servers specifically for “Old School” RuneScape.
